# TIMS
This repository contains my comprehensive report on the Tools Information Management System (TIMS) at the Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC). The report provides an in-depth analysis of the development process, key features, architecture, and technologies used in the project. It also covers challenges faced and solutions implemented, along with future enhancements and potential use cases.
